# Forecast-Challenge-1-Code-ECON-8710
My professor issued a challenge to see who take a data set and use it to predict the next year most accurately. This is the Python code I used to help come up with my answer.

The repository contains the data set issued by my professor, the python code I used, and a writeup of my method.

The data set contains months and sales for each months. THe goal was to predict the next year.

My python code reorganizes the data into a plottable format, which I used to analyze the data. I then created binary variables for certain months to use in a regression. I saved the formatted data and dummy variables in a new csv which I then performed regressions on in R.
